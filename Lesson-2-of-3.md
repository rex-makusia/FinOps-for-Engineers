# What is FinOps ?
Cloud FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice.
- FinOps enables organization to get maximum business value by heling engineering, finance, and business team to collaborate to make data driven spending decisions.

# Financial Accountability
- As an engineer, you are increasingly entrusted with the authority to commit the company to spending in the public cloud, and you will increasingly be expected to deliver greater value for that spending.

# Usage Optimization & Rate Optimization
- At a fundamental level, cloud spend is the product of usage and rates (usage x rate = cost). A key objective of FinOps teams is to promote both cost avoidance (related to usage) and cost optimization (related to rates).

  ```Time or Usage``` X ```Rate``` = ```Cost```

FinOps teams will focus on both **usage optimization**, ensuring resources in the cloud are only running when they are being used, and **rate optimization**, ensuring we pay the least we need to for the resources that we decide we need to be running at any given time. Using rate and usage optimization in combination allows us to get the best value for our spending in cloud. **As engineers, you play a pivotal role in usage optimization by avoiding unnecessary costs through architecting and building systems considering cost as a first class requirement.** When architecting, you can optimize by taking time to find the best architecture fit for your purpose by using the right mix of services to solve the right business problems. Additionally, you can optimize running systems to ensure they are operating efficiently, only running when necessary, scaling appropriately to their workloads at any given time, and cleaning up after themselves by deleting resources as they shut down.

# Bringing in FinOps
- FinOps is built on the following six guiding principles:
## Teams need to collaborate 
- Public cloud brings new challenges and all teams can provide useful information and viewpoints. There are many different personas and teams you will work with. Learn more about each of them (opens in a new tab)here(opens in a new tab)(opens in a new tab).
## Everyone takes ownership for their cloud usage
- This may be the most impactful principle to your work. You have the power to create resources in the cloud directly. So, in addition to working to meet technical requirements of the systems you build (e.g. uptime or resiliency), you will increasingly be required to meet financial requirements as well. FinOps will help ensure you have access to the information you need to build systems that satisfy your customers' performance needs and your company's profitability requirements.
